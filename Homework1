From my point of view, I think software quanlity assurance is a subject which provides significant things during the peroid 
of development. It is to help the software project management people make the process of development visible to them. SQA is 
also helpful and significant for the efficiency of the developing process. So I think it is of great importance for us to 
learn take this course. I do believe I will get a copy when I finish this course.
