How to ensure the quality of software system

QA is of great importance to a softare system and we need to pay attention on how to ensure the 
quality of software system. In this article, I want to take diandian as the target system to explain 
why it is important.

Overall, QA is different from Defect and QA is focusing on correctness aspact of Quality. Dealing with
defect is one job for QA. As to Diandian app, we must consider the impact on costumers of the functions
before the production release. when developing this app, the functions realization must be considered 
and the stabity and robustness are important. In a word, many things need to be considered to ensure the
quality of software system.
