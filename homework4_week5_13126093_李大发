My understanding of formal methods in general and model checking in particular.

Generally speaking, formal methods includes formal specification and formal verification since 
there is a formula: Formal methods = formal specification + formal verification.

Formal specifications are mathematically based techniques whose purpose are to help with the 
implementation of systems and software. They are used to describe a system, to analyze its 
behavior, and to aid in its design by verifying key properties of interest through rigorous 
and effective reasoning tools. 

Formal verification is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms
underlying a system with respect to a certain formal specification or property, using formal 
methods of mathematics. The verification of these systems is done by providing a formal proof 
on an abstract mathematical model of the system, the correspondence between the mathematical 
model and the nature of the system being otherwise known by construction.

As to the model checking, one approach to formal verification is model checking, which consists
of a systematically exhaustive exploration of the mathematical model. Usually this consists of
exploring all states and transitions in the model, by using smart and domain-specific abstraction
techniques to consider whole groups of states in a single operation and reduce computing time.
