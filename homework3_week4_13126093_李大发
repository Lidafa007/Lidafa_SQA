How to construct DDG?

From the chapter 11, we have the overall strategy and basic steps to do it.

Overall strategy: 1. Backward chaining/resolution
                  2. Computation flow
                        result backward
                        implementation forward
                  3. For DDGs based on specifications

Basic steps:

                  1. Identify output variable(s) (OV)
                  2. Backward chaining to resolve OV
                        variables used in its computation
                        identify D-U relations
                        repeat above steps for other variables
                        until all resolved as input/constants
                  3. Handling conditional definitions in above
