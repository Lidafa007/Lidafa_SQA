 
  In this week I have read the content of these chapters and summary the main content I've got.  


  The main content can be divided into 4 Parts: SQA in software process, SQE Activities, white-box testing and Black-box 
testing.
  The traditional software process (waterfall development process) include requirement, specification, design, coding, 
testing, release. QA is exist in all phase of the software process. QA is important in all processes. A quality product is one 
which meets its requirements and satisfies the user. SQC activities include mentoring how to produce artifacts, such as well-defined
engineering documents using standard templates, mentoring how to conduct standard processes, such as quality reviews, Perform 
in-process quality reviews to verify, evaluate and confirm artifacts, verify and evaluate to improve the use of methods, procedures
and adopted software tools.
  As to the SQE Activities, I learned that in the software process, firstly SQE  need to do quality planning to set quality goals, 
and then select the measurements&models to do some quality assessments and improvement, finally to analysis if the quality goals 
is satisfied. 
  What I got about testing is that oftware testing methods are traditionally divided into white- and black-box testing. These two 
approaches are used to describe the point of view that a test engineer takes when designing test cases.

  At last I want to say that I have already rated my group members' homeworks and learn more from different angles.
